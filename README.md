# CryptGuard

**CryptGuard** is a web-based platform designed to help users identify various encryption methods and decrypt text. Whether you're working with historical ciphers or modern encryption techniques, CryptGuard can assist you in deciphering encrypted messages.

## Features

- **Encryption Detection**: Identify different types of encryption methods such as Atbash, XOR, Rail Fence, ROT13, and more.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt text using the identified methods with the correct keys.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for entering text and keys for decryption.
- **Multiple Encryption Methods**: Supports a wide range of ciphers including Atbash, XOR, Rail Fence, ROT13, Scytale, Reverse, Beaufort, Vigenère, Caesar, and Base64.

CryptGuard can identify and work with the following encryption methods:

- **Atbash Cipher**
- **XOR Cipher**
- **Rail Fence Cipher**
- **ROT13**
- **Scytale**
- **Reverse Cipher**
- **Beaufort Cipher**
- **Vigenère Cipher**
- **Caesar Cipher**
